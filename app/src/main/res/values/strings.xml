He walked down a busy street\n
Staring solely at his feet\n
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side\n
Stood at the table where she sat\n
And removed his hat\n
In respect of her presence\n
Presents her with the pictures and says\n
"These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.\n
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"\n
Opened up his little heart\n
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark\n
And read a written warning...\n
